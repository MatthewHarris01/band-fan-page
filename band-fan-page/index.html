		<h1>My Favorite band: Jethro Tull</H1>
		<p>One of my all-time favorite music groups is "Jethro Tull"</p>
		<h2>How I encountered Jethro Tull</h2>
		<p>When I was about 11 years old, my family lived on the island of Grenada in the West Indies, where they ran a Charter Boat business.
			A friend of my father's in the United States would, every couple of months, send my father a cassette tape of music. Usually he sent tapes 
			of classical music, or things like recordings of antique music boxes. One tape he sent was simply labeled "Jethro Tull".</p>
			<p>I did not usually listen to the tapes from my father's friend, because at the age of 11 I had little or no appreciation of 
				classical music, and recordings of antique music boxes didn't hold my interest beyond a single listening.</P>
				<p>One day, though, because I was bored with the available selection of music that we had in the house, I decided to 
				listen to the Jethro Tull tape. There was one song on the tape that really caught my interest: "Fat Man". It was a peppy sort of 
				folk-rock song, and the lyrics were somewhat amusing ("I see the other side to being thin, roll us both down a mountain, and I'm sure the fat man would win."). 
				I ended up listening to that Jethro Tull tape often.</p>
				<p>In addition to "Fat Man" there was another piece on that cassette that really caught my interest: "Bouree". Bouree was another 
					uptempo piece with an engaging arrangement. I learned years later that Bouree was an adaptation of "Bourr√©e in E minor" by Johann Sebastian Bach.</p>
				<p>I listened to the Jethro Tull version of Bouree so often I ended up having it memorized, and used to whistle or hum it while 
					walking or working.
				</p>					
			<p>I later learned that the Jethro Tull cassette my father's friend had sent him, contained the entirety of the "Stand Up" album.
			</p>

	<h1>Some of my other favorite Jethro Tull albums and songs</h1>
	  <p>When my family returned to the United States, I was about 15 or 16 and ended up spending a lot of time in record stores on 
			weekends and sometimes after school. There were record stores in Grenada, but the choice tended to be limited, and often they did
			not have many new releases. So, at the time my family returned to the US, "Aqualung" was a new release from Jethro Tull, and I ended up buying a copy, as well as
			a copy of "Thick as a Brick". Although I enjoyed "Thick As A Brick", "Aqualung" was the album that had songs on it that I liked 
			best, and were more unusual compared to other music that I and my friends typically listened to.</p>
		<p>One of the songs from the Aqualung album that deeply caught my fancy was "Locomotive Breath" -- it had driving rhythms that made
			me want to "head-bang", and lyrics that for some reason, at the age of 16, I identified with heavily, such as "Charlie stole the handle,
			and the train, it won't stop going, no way to slow down" -- I guess at that time in my life, events seemed to be happening beyond my control, and 
			at an excessively rapid pace.
		</p>

	 <h2>Yet More Favorite Songs</h2>
	 <p>Some time in the late 1980's, I came across a Jethro Tull compilatation album "Living in the Past". I bought it and rushed home to listen to it, 
		 as I could tell from the song list on the album cover that it had several songs I had never heard before</p>
		 <p>As I had anticipated, there were songs on the "Living In the Past" album that rapidly became my new favorites. The first was a piece
			 called "Teacher", which I liked because the story in the song was about how the singer had been approached by someone who called himself
			 the teacher, and offered to teach the singer how to enjoy life, but was really just fooling the singer into funding the teacher's 
			good times. I had recently had a similar experience with a former friend, letting him trick me into funding his 
			activities under the guise that he was teaching me something about life.</p>
			<p>Another song on "Living in the Past" that became a favorit of mine is "Life is a Long Song" -- a happy/sad song "dont' you fret, don't you fear, I will give you 
				good cheer" as a happy refrain, yet "Life is a long song, but the tune ends too soon for us all" as a sad refrain. </p>
